The last challenge is using stacks to move items from one tower to another tower recursively until all the items are moved to the desired location in a specified order.
The first item on top of the stack should be lighter than the last item down the stack and that means that the items grow in size 

# Methods 
pop() - Removes  the last item on the stack
push() - Adds item to the last index of the stack
peer() - View the last item on the stack

Other notable methods that can be used include:
 append()
